\label{part1}

\begin{itemize}
\item Using the pages from A3 that boilerpipe successfully processed, download those representations again \& reprocess them with boilerpipe.:
\item Document the time difference (e.g., Time(A4) â€“ Time(A3)).
\item Compute the Jaccard Distance x for each pair of pages (i.e., P(A3) \& P(A4) for:
 \begin{itemize}
\item Unique terms (i.e., unigrams)
\item Bigrams
\item Trigrams
\end{itemize}
\item See:\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index }
\item For each of the 3 cases (i.e., 1-, 2-, 3-grams) build a Cumulative Distribution Function that shows the \% change on the x-axis \& the \% of the population on the x-axis
\item See:\url {http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function}
\item Give 3-4 examples illustrating the range of change that you have measured.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Solution}

\begin{itemize}
	\item I used same script getText.py from A3 which uses jusText\cite{jusText} to remove templates from HTML files of 10000 URIs.
	\item jusText\cite{jusText} is a tool for removing boilerplate content such as navigation links, headers and footers from HTML pages.
	\item Time Difference between processing boilerpipe of A3 and A4 is 27 days.
	\item 
\end{itemize}

 \subsection{Code Listing}
Below is the python code that is used to remove HTML templates from all HTML pages of 10000 URIs.
