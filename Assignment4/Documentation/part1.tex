\label{part1}

\begin{itemize}
\item Using the pages from A3 that boilerpipe successfully processed, download those representations again & reprocess them with boilerpipe.:
\item Document the time difference (e.g., Time(A4) â€“ Time(A3)).
\item Compute the Jaccard Distance x for each pair of pages (i.e., P(A3) & P(A4) for:
 \begin{itemize}
\item Unique terms (i.e., unigrams)
\item Bigrams
\item Trigrams
\end{itemize}
\item See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index 
\item For each of the 3 cases (i.e., 1-, 2-, 3-grams) build a Cumulative Distribution Function that shows the % change on the x-axis & the % of the population on the x-axis
\item See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function
\item Give 3-4 examples illustrating the range of change that you have measured.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Solution}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Installed jusText\cite{jusText} to remove templates from HTML files of 10000 URIs.
	\item jusText is a tool for removing boilerplate content such as navigation links, headers and footers from HTML pages.
\end{itemize}

 \subsection{Code Listing}
Below is the python code that is used to remove HTML templates from all HTML pages of 10000 URIs.

\lstinputlisting[language=Python,breaklines = true,frame=single,caption={Python program to remove HTML templates}, label=lst:q1-1,captionpos=b,numbers=left,showspaces=false,showstringspaces=false,basicstyle=\footnotesize]{getText.py}

Here is the python code that is used to count total words, unique words and frequency. Basic parsing of the text files
is referred from wordcount python library\cite{Wordcount}.

\lstinputlisting[language=Python,breaklines = true,frame=single,caption={Python program for finding unique words and total words}, label=lst:q1-1,captionpos=b,numbers=left,showspaces=false,showstringspaces=false,basicstyle=\footnotesize]{wordcount.py}

\subsection{Comparing total words, unique words and byte sizes}


\begin{table}
\caption{Original and After jusText}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ c | c | c }
    \hline
     & Before jusText & After jusText \\ \hline
Total Bytes & 813,340,810   &  650,600  \\ \hline
Total Words & 305,559 and & 105,559 \\ \hline
Unique Words & 40,011 and & 20,611 \\ 
\label{table:comparision}
 \end{tabular}
 \end{center}

\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
\item Comparison of total words, unique words and total bytes before use of jusText is shown in table \ref{table:comparision}.
\item Out of my 10000 URIs, 6200 were unique URIs. In this list of URIs 4643 was jusText successful.
\item Remaining 1566 were skipped due to errors like `404', could not resolve host, etc. as shown below.

\begin{verbatim}
	$ curl -I http://waniko.info/u70xbs/
	curl: (6) Could not resolve host: waniko.info
	
	$ curl -I http://truffle.upper.jp/44p3z
	HTTP/1.1 302 Found
	Date: Sat, 04 Apr 2015 04:23:10 GMT
	Server: Apache/2.0.58 (Unix) mod_bwshare/0.2.0 PHP/5.3.8
	Location: http://err.lolipop.jp/404.html
\end{verbatim}

\item Few of them are non-HTML and they were skipped due to errors as shown below.
\begin{verbatim}
8 URIs pointing to Images of Instagram
3 URIS from facebook site
2 URIs which are pointing to sites with no content.
\end{verbatim}

\item Examples of URIs for which jusText was successful are listed below. Pages which are properly structured with HTML 5 tags like section, caption, footer, header are successful.

\begin{itemize}
\item http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/02/09/rumor-apple-to-again-stay-out-of-megapixel-race
\item http://www.aztecanoticias.com.mx/notas/finanzas/212592/bolsas-de-europa-en
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Classes of pages for which jusText was not successful are given below.

\begin{itemize}
\item http://news.uvs.jp/1D4
\item http://gharedly.com/
\end{itemize}


\item Pages which are cluttered with HTML elements and have not followed guidelines for HTML page design are not successful.
