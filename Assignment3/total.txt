We're not saying to go crazy on the milkshakes, of course.

DEL CITY, OKâStunned by his immense breadth of knowledge and quiet confidence while discussing the issue, friends of local man Eric Bridges told reporters Monday the 28-year-oldâs ironclad understanding of gas prices was able to withstand a barrage of not just one, but two follow-up questions. âAfter Eric mentioned something about how the price of gas is starting to rise again, I asked him if itâll keep going up, and then our friend Luke asked him a completely different question about why itâs cheaper in certain places, and he was able to answer both just like that,â said friend Alex Tischer, who reportedly marveled as Bridges gave an all-knowing, 15-second description of what OPEC is and does. âHe didnât even pause to think; as soon as we finished asking, he jumped right in with a response. Iâm telling you, the guy really knows his stuff.â At press time, Bridges reportedly blew the groupâs mind by asking if they wanted to know anything else.

Apple honestly doesnât need to worry much about a feature gap emerging between iOS and any competing mobile platforms, including Android, if it takes this year to focus on platform stability. The past two iOS updates have given it a decent feature and design lead, and Androidâs fragmentation issue means that most of its users are still on old software anyway. Stabilization pays dividends in terms of customer satisfaction, too, which Apple continually reiterates is one of its most important success metrics.

In 1992, after many challenges and growth spurts I began to write my way out of a deep depression and instead of poems I had the beginnings of a novel, "Finally". Since then I have written thirteen novels and nine screenplays that all beg to be heard. "Damaged!", "The Parcel Express Murders", "Inherited", and "Pearl and Angela", are currently published by BEE-CON BOOKS, and are available in paperback or hardback.

Filming was done in Australia, with funding from the Australian government.

On the other hand, the decline of marriage means adults will be poorer, less healthy, and less happy on average. In addition, many people forgoing marriage are still having children, so the decline of marriage means an increasing proportion of children will experience family instability and all its attendant risks. But beyond these utilitarian reasons, the fact that fewer and fewer Americans are able to achieve the widely shared dream of a lifelong marriage is simply tragic.

The Watergate tapes revealed a lot about former President Richard Nixon, including his favorite curse words.

That quote marked the first time the New York Times printed the word "sh*t."

Another round of US-Russia tensions might be unfolding, but such a clash was neither foreordained nor inevitable; between the two largely distant lands there is mutual nuclear deterrence and an absence of directly conflicting vital interests. Beyond inane sloganeering about democracy and human rights, more sophisticated Western strategists can cite new iterations ofHalford Mackinderâs Heartland thesisor the latest Eurasian pipeline maneuvers as reasons to âcontainâ Russia. None of this accounts for acosmopolitan oligarchythat sets policy, subsidizes scholarship, and manufactures consent in pursuit of its totalitarian agenda. In their quest to liquidate the American, the Russian, and every other unique people, the predators from the bankster international consider themselves above all laws human and divine. Yet the swelling arrogance of sociopaths brings about their downfall â and the sooner their crime spree comes to an end, the better chance we all might have for peace and reconciliation.-------Footnote: It should be noted that even Russia is still not free of the banksters in its own state apparatus, with the Central Bank and the Medvedev government under the influence of pro-Western liberal technocrats familiar with Putin from his days in St. Petersburg. With economic warfare waged by the international a present-day reality, it would be reasonable to expect a quick resolution to this problem in the near future.

By Daina Beth Solomon LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Rap mogul Marion "Suge" Knight will stay in jail for at least five more weeks in a fatal hit-and-run case after a judge agreed to a request by defense lawyers to postpone a bail hearing set for Monday. Knight, the 49-year-old co-founder of influential label Death Row Records, is being held without bail on murder and felony hit-and-run charges in connection with the Jan. 29 incident at Tam's Burgers in the Los Angeles suburb of Compton. Defense lawyers had sought the hearing to petition Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ricardo Ocampo to set bond for Knight. Ocampo also rejected a request by defense attorney David Kenner to allow Knight's personal physician to visit him in jail, saying the county had plenty of competent doctors to attend to him.

Per the film's official synopsis, "Golden Kingdom" was shot entirely in Mynmar with non-professional actors. Given the film's sophisticated imagery and the complicated geopolitical circumstances surrounding production -- the country formerly known as Burma only just recently reopened its borders in 2011 to the rest of the world -- it's hard to believe that director Brian Perkins is actually a first-time filmmaker. Check out the trailer for "Golden Kingdom" below, exclusively on Indiewire.

MOBILE, ALâSaying the memories they made today would last the rest of their lives, gay couple Jeremy Newell and Aaron Mitchum of Mobile, AL confirmed Monday that they had always dreamed of getting married surrounded by hostility. âEveryone has big expectations about their wedding day, but never in a million years could I have imagined the tremendous outpouring of anger and contempt that we received from everyone who turned out,â said Newell, adding that as the newly married same-sex couple exited the courthouse they were overwhelmed with emotion upon seeing so many familiar, spiteful faces. âIt was just unbelievable that our commitment to each other brought so many people together to share their hate with us. I even got a little teary-eyed when I looked out at the crowd shouting homophobic slurs and expressing their wishes for us to burn in hell. Iâll never forget that.â At press time, the happy couple were driving away from the courthouse in their decorated wedding car at top speed.

Colombian boy Didier had a mole problem. He was diagnosed with Congenital Melanocytic Nevus (CMN), which resulted in a mole covering the entirety of his back. The weight kept him from the activities that every little boy should enjoy, but his family couldnât afford the surgery to remove the birthmark. A surgeon from England agreed to do the surgery pro-bono and Didier is now mole free.

MOBILE, ALâSaying the memories they made today would last the rest of their lives, gay couple Jeremy Newell and Aaron Mitchum of Mobile, AL confirmed Monday that they had always dreamed of getting married surrounded by hostility. âEveryone has big expectations about their wedding day, but never in a million years could I have imagined the tremendous outpouring of anger and contempt that we received from everyone who turned out,â said Newell, adding that as the newly married same-sex couple exited the courthouse they were overwhelmed with emotion upon seeing so many familiar, spiteful faces. âIt was just unbelievable that our commitment to each other brought so many people together to share their hate with us. I even got a little teary-eyed when I looked out at the crowd shouting homophobic slurs and expressing their wishes for us to burn in hell. Iâll never forget that.â At press time, the happy couple were driving away from the courthouse in their decorated wedding car at top speed.

Speaking after the case, Ms Walsh said: âIâm livid with the sentence. He should have got five to ten years. Itâs definitely not long enough after everything heâs put our family through.â

And because the US dollar was named after the Spanish peso de ocho "dollar" coin, the same peso symbol was ultimately used to refer to pesos and dollars both.

rchant(s) thought it would be even cooler to write the P and S on top of each other. This apparently caught on, and by the 1770s they had dropped the bowl from the P entirely, reducing the shorthand to an S crossed with the vestigial stem of what once was a P. And thus was born a brand new symbol, still used to mean peso today: the peso sign ($).

To be honest, I know NOTHING about 50 Shades of Grey. The only thing I know about the novels are that they are raunchy and has a lot of sexual scenes between the two main characters. Obviously, this isnât my type of film to watch, but the reason why I want to see this film is because I want to know the hype that 50 Shades is gathering. Iâve been hearing that the film will mostly be faithful to the book, and if thatâs true, then Iâm for sure in for an experience. And thatâs what I want from this film: a reaction. Iâm hoping that this movie will suprise me in a good way, and in the end, maybe enjoy the film adaptation of 50 Shades. Either way, Iâm excited but still optimistic about 50 Shades of Grey. Thank you NotaUtil.com for this opportunity and this contest, and I wish everyone the best of luck. Sexy time on the big screen is coming soon near you!

she landed on the runway, stood there for seconds, later visited with the troops. Took photographs with them. There was no apparent danger to us. There was no mention of it. There was no corkscrew landing. There was no sniper fire. So, you kind of wonder in both instances there were so many other people who knew this wasnât true, how they got away so long with telling the story. How they thought they would get away with this without somebody coming to them saying, âThat didnât happen.â â¦To me part of the irony is, if Brian Williams isnât able to survive itâ¦ And yet we didnât care as much with somebody who became our Secretary of State. Is it really more important that Brian Williams has a certain character and honesty that a presidential candidate or Secretary of State?

In other words, I also was putting the Earth between the Earth and the Moon. Oops.

Foods high in saturated fats tend to be high in calories, and eating a calorie-rich diet and gaining unnecessary weight isn't good for anyone's health. All that said, it's important to know that saturated fat isn't the devil that everyone has made it out to be and can be enjoyed as part of a sensible diet.

MOBILE, ALâSaying the memories they made today would last the rest of their lives, gay couple Jeremy Newell and Aaron Mitchum of Mobile, AL confirmed Monday that they had always dreamed of getting married surrounded by hostility. âEveryone has big expectations about their wedding day, but never in a million years could I have imagined the tremendous outpouring of anger and contempt that we received from everyone who turned out,â said Newell, adding that as the newly married same-sex couple exited the courthouse they were overwhelmed with emotion upon seeing so many familiar, spiteful faces. âIt was just unbelievable that our commitment to each other brought so many people together to share their hate with us. I even got a little teary-eyed when I looked out at the crowd shouting homophobic slurs and expressing their wishes for us to burn in hell. Iâll never forget that.â At press time, the happy couple were driving away from the courthouse in their decorated wedding car at top speed.

The Suicide Club was probably best known at the time for its bridge climbing exploits. The Club, though secretive during its lifespan, influenced many future cultural and artistic endeavors. The Billboard Liberation Front began as a Suicide Club event hosted by Gary Warne in 1977. Author Don Herron's Dashiell Hammett Walking Tour, the longest lived literary tour in America began in the Suicide Club in 1977. The Chinese New Years Treasure Hunt[5] was created by Gary Warne in 1977 and continues (albeit in a different form) to this day. John Gilmore, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation was a Suicide Club member. Sexologist Dr. Susan Block was also a member.[6] The Cacophony Society was founded by ex Suicide Clubbers in 1986. Members of the Cacophony Society organized San Francisco's first SantaCon, adopted later and spread throughout the world by the Cacophony Society.[4] There are now Cacophony Societies throughout the world. The Burning Man Festival was influenced by Cacophony and many former Suicide Club members were crucial organizers in the early days of the desert event. The "leave no trace" mantra of Burning Man was borrowed from the Suicide Club and the philosophy of Warne.

We have been selling Hatfield Dog Collars since 1990. As a practicing veterinarian for 35 years, I observed many instances when a reluctant dog would pull back on his leash and slip his collar over his head and be free to run into traffic, or resist being caught. All of our âControl Collarsâ and the patented âLeash Collarâ will prevent this from happening. The " Control Collar" should be adjusted to be just large enough to comfortably slip over the dog's head. That will allow it to be loose enough to be worn all the time. The collar will tighten enough to keep it from slipping off when pressure is applied from a leash. The "Leash Collar" will fit any size dog. You simply loosen the cambuckle, make a loop, put it around the dog's neck, tighten it enough that it will not slip off, and lock the cambuckle. It will neither tighten or loosen at this point.Our collars are made of nylon mesh that is light weight, washable and will grow with your dog. Thatâs right! You can buy a size your puppy can grow into without compromising the level of control you have over your puppy. As they grow you can adjust the size to make sure the collar will not open up and allow your pet to get free and possible get hurt or lost. All of these are great reasons to buy our Hatfield Control Dog Collars but the best reason is the price; all of our collars are under $5 and sold all over the nation including Walmart Online & Walmart Stores.

Peter A. Elvidge - Artist StatementI am a Pixel Artist. I have been visually impaired since I was born. I was born with Congenital Cataracts, and then developed Glaucoma when I was 4 months old. Glaucoma won the battle for that eye!! I am once again fighting glaucoma for my sight in my last eye, and I am still hanging on some! All this before I turned 22 years old! I love creating art, but due to recent vision changes, I have had to change how I do things. I started doing pixel art after discovering it on the internet. It is my way of making pictures so the world can see all the colors and shades that make up the sighted world. Each piece of art was constructed pixel (square) by pixel (square). Crazy, right? Now I bet your asking "How can he do this?" Well, I'll give you a very brief example. There are so many parts to my techniques. I first imagine a picture. Most inspiration comes from interests and life's visual experiences. After I have an idea I start to play with colors and shades. Then I use a mix of technology's to create rough drafts then the final product. Save, print, and boom I'm done! I have many works with their own meanings, and I hope you find your own special meanings in my work as well!

His <em>The Jones</em> project was a well-received release that proved he could function both as a punchline rapper and an auto-tuned ballad singer while being fully functional behind the boards, producing much of his own music.

And we ainât a rap clique, we're a family.<br /><br /><strong>What is a common misconception of SaveMoney?</strong><br />I think the common misconception is that we're just a rap group. No, we're just a big ass family that happens to rap. We never started SaveMoney as a rap group. That wasn't on any of our minds, it just happened that way.<br /><br /><strong>Whatâs your role in the larger framework of SaveMoney?</strong><br />Iâm both an artist and a producer, so I approach things from both sides in that sense. I see myself just being a help and an asset to all of my brothers, whether it's on or off the track.<br /><br /><strong>Does having so many different artistic aesthetics throughout the group drive you to explore new territories musically?</strong><br />All the time. Iâm always finding out new music and ways to express myself through sound because of my bros. I think all of us have a rich taste in music.<br /><br /><strong>Who should the country be looking out for this year from SaveMoney?</strong><br />I think people should be on the lookout for Joey Purp, Sterling Hayes and Brian Fresco. This year is ours.<br /><br /><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0RRCQ19iJFA" height="380" width="670" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>

The criminal state security forces of Bampour base, south of Iran, shot and killed a Balouchi youth on Saturday Feb. 7th. People gathered around the base and demanded punishment and judgment for the ones who were responsible of murdering the young man. The repressive security forces fearing the soaring popular anger hid the real criminals declining to hand over or identify the perpetrators. They said there were 5 guards involved, but refused to identify those five who shot the innocent young man. They promised to investigate and asked the people to leave.During the previous 3 days, at least 4 Balouchi citizens has been killed or injured under the pretext of mullahâs self-made accusation of carrying illicit merchandise and fuel. In all three cases the shots were fired directly at their heads which killed them instantly.

Together we can raise Â£3,400 to provide lifesaving water to communities across the world.

The federal government pledged $3.2 million on Monday to help save the monarch butterfly, the iconic orange-and-black butterfly that can migrate thousands of miles between the U.S. and Mexico each year. It has experienced a 90 percent decline in population recently. About $2 million will restore more than 200,000 acres of habitat from California to the Corn Belt, including more than 750 schoolyard habitats and pollinator gardens. The rest will be used to start a conservation fund that will provide grants to farmers and other landowners to conserve habitat. The move by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service comes as it considers whether to classify the monarch butterfly as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, which would afford the butterfly more protection. "We can save the monarch butterfly in North America but only if we act quickly and together," said Service Director Dan Ashe. The monarch lays its eggs exclusively on the milkweed plant. Conversion of prairies into cropland and the increasing use of pesticide-resistant crops have greatly reduced milkweed, which is also an important food source, particularly in the heartland, according to the petition filed last August by environmental groups.

@uncompetative I get what OP is trying to say. I choose not to use the hook, but the problem with that choice is in multiplayer, where we're racing towards an objective, and the guys leave us in the dust with the grappling hook. It also renders a lot of the parkour traveling in the game useless, kind of like in Saints Row 4, where flying like a superhero makes it absolutely pointless to even have a car.

The article warned that the disappearance of sharks from our oceans â mostly through overfishing although shark nets and safety killings add to the problem â is not as unlikely as it might once have been. And if it were to happen, the repercussions would be far-reaching as, for example, world fish stocks could decline even further as lower-tier ocean predators swim into the sharkâs void. âIn many ways the shark is the poster child for the decline of the sea,â said George Burgess of Shark Attack File. âIf this apex predator, which through 400 million years of evolution does kill humans, rightly or wrongly, is able to so readily be struck down by humans in less than 100 years, what does that say for the rest of the sea?â

(CN) - A woman who owes a judgment more than $62 million to Wells Fargo and Regions Bank must answer claims she fraudulently transferred funds to avoid payment, a federal judge ruled. Wells Fargo and Regions Bank sued Sabrina Barber and her company, Blaker Enterprises LLC, for making fraudulent transfers in order to avoid paying a judgment owed to the banks. The deficiency comes from a 2010 foreclosure judgment. After the judgment was entered, Barber allegedly transferred substantial amounts to at least three different accounts. The banks also allege Barber received $1 million in a divorce settlement that should have been put toward paying the outstanding judgment, but instead she withdrew sums of more than $200,000 at a time. The banks filed a complaint seeking injunctive relief, for Barber's interest in Blaker Enterprises to be foreclosed, and to have Barber ordered to stop making withdrawals on the basis of their being fraud and constructive fraud. Barber asked the court to dismiss the case due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. The judge declined to give the banks injunctive relief, but upheld all other claims. In doing so, U.S. District Judge Paul Bryon said injunctive relief would be inappropriate because liability in the case has yet to be proven. He also held that because Barber and Blaker Enterprises reside in Florida, subject matter jurisdiction is proper. According to the order, the banks sufficiently pleaded their claim regarding a charging order and foreclosure of Barber's interest in Blaker since she is the sole member and a charging order would not timely allow the judgment to be paid. Judge Byron concluded that Barber did in fact make the transfers to avoid paying the judgment since the transfers were to an insider, she retained possession of the funds, and she was insolvent at the time she made the transfers. Byron further reasoned that Barber transferred the money shortly after the judgment was entered against her, but shortly before the banks sued for deficiency judgment. Barber has until February 18 to answer the complaint.

Van Gaalâs reputation as a ruthless, single-minded operator will have been music to the ears of United supporters after Dithering Daveâs time in charge but thus far the axe has only fallen on relatively easy targets. For United to realise the attacking potential of this group of players, the Dutchman needs to swallow his pride and either restore Rooney to the forward line at Falcao or Van Persieâs expense or revoke the privileges he has said he affords his captain, dropping the Redsâ erstwhile talisman to the bench. A big call either way, but with a resurgent Tottenham and Liverpool joining Arsenal and Southampton in the mix, the all-important return of Champions League football to Old Trafford may depend on it.

It starts off where it ended in the first one. Sin waits for Bleu to return to him. Abram still wants to kill Bleu. A solution to that problem is made. The lifestyle within The Fellowship is learned.The stories predictable. I'm waiting for the suspense and action to take place. The stories complacent and stagnant. I was not expecting to read about celebrations and fertility clinics. I wanted answers to who killed her mother. The Fellowship does not have much action going on. I was expecting raids and killings.It took long enough to reach the action. I realize the story needed to be set up with details but I felt they dragged on for far too long. This second second sets the pace for the final book which looks to hold all the suspense and action. I think I will enjoy the final book more.I know my review will not please many readers, but it is my opinion. It is not necessary for you to state that my review was not helpful because it is my opinion therefore leave it alone.

Bleu MacAllister is consumed. A horrific childhood incident has caused every decision in her life to revolve around bringing a monster to justice. With years spent studying The Fellowship, an organized crime brotherhood of liars, thieves, and killers, Bleu will rely on her skills as a special agent to cut Thane Breckenridge off at the knees. But walking hand in hand with retribution means risking collateral damage, in the form of Breckenridgeâs son Sinclairâuntil Sin becomes so much more than Bleu bargained for. Sheâs always known this undertaking would place her life in dangerâshe never imagined her heart would be as well.

A surgeon from England agreed to do the surgery pro-bono and Didier is now mole free.

Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, a Massachusetts woman named Esther Howland was building her reputation as the âMother of the American Valentineâ for designing and popularizing high-quality lace-paper Valentine cards featuring messages of love and devotion. It was unusual at the time for a woman to run a business, yet Howland set up an all-female assembly line and kept the New England Valentine Company thriving for decades. First and foremost, one museum curator said of Howland to NPR, âSheâs a businesswoman â¦ I mean it is lacy, beautiful, feminine material that sheâs producing, but sheâs producing it successfully and making money.â

Parkfield found themselves 2-1 down at half time and had to play much better in the second half if they were to claim a victory over their local rivals. They changed their style of play: passing much quicker and more precise in the second half. This enabled Oliver and Aiden to add to the goal scored in the first half and Parkfield ended up winning 3-2. All the players were excellent on the night and Parkfield thoroughly deserved their victory. Onwards and upwards team Parkfield!

Flashbacks! Misleading cold opens that show a funeral! Repeating the same footage over and over! Dumb Instagram filters! Itâs OK to take chances when you make something.

But social media will always be an incongruous and gross place for brands to mingle, because all brands are inherently psychopathic. A company does not have feelings. It will never love you. It does not love its workers. It likely screws them over. Think about that the next time you tweet at a brand, or defend one online. Treating brands like buddies isn't just embarrassing for all partiesâsympathy for a brand is antipathy for all humans. The great friending of the brand undermines the vital skepticism of corporate America and capitalism altogether. It's horrid enough that our laws treat corporations as peopleâto treat them as personal friends is just rotten.

After essentially being prevented from building their controversial blocks of flats on the Kelvin river bank by the amount of conditions attached to GCC permission to build (if my memory serves me there were a whopping 27 conditions some of them punitive) everthing went quiet for a while. This was thanks to the massive public support the Otago Lane community received. The developer Hugh Scott did make various appearances on the lane which were less than pleasant for customers and residents. Even this subsided. In June we realised that we had to carry out some routine but quite extensive maintenance to the veranda. Some agents for Hugh Scott tipped him off about what was happening resulting in his bringing us to court (after a couple of pretty unpleasant letters) and accusing us of building a new veranda. This was in order to force the ceasing of works on the veranda and its removal. Fortunately there is an unbelievable amount of evidence on the web and elsewhere as well as literally thousands of witnesses to say that the veranda has been there for far longer than a few months. We therefore managed to win the case with the help of Inksters law firm. This was the first financial hit as this case cost us over Â£1000. Now we are at court again. Due to the developer employing an advocate, we have had to match that. The aim is to stop us from using the veranda - an essential part of the shop not least because it is our only access. Why should he do this since he may not be able to build anyway? We know he could be very angry due to not being able to build easily a development that would have destroyed part of the Green corridor, the character of the area and the businesses on the lane. We also know that because Tchai-Ovna spearheaded the campaign, he might be particularly angry with us. He knows that we are a small business with only small means and that by forcing us to go to court he can financially hemorrhage our operations. It looks as though the legal case will run into tens of thousands of pounds. With us gone he will have got rid of a major thorn in his side and he can afford to do it. This is why we need as much financial help as possible in order to help fight this in the courts. If we win this will help secure Tchai-Ovna in Otago lane on the long term. If we lose not only will we be in total financial dire straights due to having to cover his costs, but we will in effect be put out of business. We have come as far as we can without asking people who support Tchai-Ovna and Otago Lane for financial help, but now we have no choice. We really appreciate any support you can give us, and are massively thankful for your help thus far otherwise Tchai-Ovna would long ago have ceased to exist and the Lane drastically changed for the worse.

When we did get 18888947 bread basket, it wasn't as great as she remembered it to be... she said they changed it up... I wasn't too impressed with it either...

The Recording Academy ventured into a social issue for the second year, supporting the fight against rape and domestic violence with a taped message from President Obama, a solemn performance from Perry that followed an abuse survivor detailing her story and a promo for the campaign to end sexual assault on campuses, "It's On Us" (ItsOnUs.org). Fortunately, it, too, felt like an honest plea and not a gratuitous plug.

English 101: Composition, an introduction course, familiarizes students with a variety of writing styles and purposes. Topics covered in this class include effective study habits, critical reading, analyzing and writing about literature, persuasion, informative writing, and how to address an audience. The course requires you to have a good grasp of English grammar, though it will cover some of the most common mistakes. English 101 is a basic requirement for most degree programs, but is also useful for those who arenât in school, but who need to write and communicate well for a career, or for everyday life. These podcasts are pre-recorded two to three times weekly and serve as core lecture material. You will find a mix of video, audio, and pdf formats, and some topics covered will include all three. Videos will not exceed 5 minutes, and podcasts will generally run around 10. I can be reached by emailing ndbailey@hacc.edu. Enjoy!

When I first heard Jago, a restaurant with a focus on Ashkenazi dishes was opening, I was intrigued. My heritage is Ashkenazi Jewish, which means my roots can be traced back to Central and Eastern Europe as opposed to Sephardi Jews, who mostly originate in Spain and Portugal, among other places. The Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews mainly subscribe to the same religious ideas but some varying interpretations lead to a slight difference in culture and practices. One instance is Passover, as my uncle is a Sephardi he has some different traditions for example he eats rice, whereas Ashkenzi Jews avoid it.

MOBILE, ALâSaying the memories they made today would last the rest of their lives, gay couple Jeremy Newell and Aaron Mitchum of Mobile, AL confirmed Monday that they had always dreamed of getting married surrounded by hostility. âEveryone has big expectations about their wedding day, but never in a million years could I have imagined the tremendous outpouring of anger and contempt that we received from everyone who turned out,â said Newell, adding that as the newly married same-sex couple exited the courthouse they were overwhelmed with emotion upon seeing so many familiar, spiteful faces. âIt was just unbelievable that our commitment to each other brought so many people together to share their hate with us. I even got a little teary-eyed when I looked out at the crowd shouting homophobic slurs and expressing their wishes for us to burn in hell. Iâll never forget that.â At press time, the happy couple were driving away from the courthouse in their decorated wedding car at top speed.

Summer 2015 is already shaping up to be the hottest one yet, and weâre not exactly blaming it on climate change. Stay tuned for more sneak peeks at Eastwoodâs campaign as the date approaches!

Knight, the 49-year-old co-founder of influential label Death Row Records, is being held without bail on murder and felony hit-and-run charges in connection with the Jan. 29 incident at Tam's Burgers in the Los Angeles suburb of Compton. Defense lawyers had sought the hearing to petition Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ricardo Ocampo to set bond for Knight. Ocampo also rejected a request by defense attorney David Kenner to allow Knight's personal physician to visit him in jail, saying the county had plenty of competent doctors to attend to him.

As we had still the Camper van, which was fully furnished and equipped, we had to think about how we convert it into a camping vehicle. There was the idea to strip it completely and build a box from 2Ã2.5 meters with a heights of 2 meters. We did not do that, because we simply could not afford it. So we took out the furniture from our camper van and adjusted it to fit into the Land Rover. So we have got storage for food and cloth, a bench to sit with table and an emergency bed, which is rather small but it is just for emergency. We bought two tents, a small one for one night stays, which is quickly pitched and a larger one, if we stay longer at a place which provides more comfort. So we had a space problem which we solved as follows: The sand ladders were fitted outside at the rear side windows, which are also a kind of protection against theft, and we had bought the Land Rover with a roof rack, where we build a simple box on it (thanks Rick from Kamanjab, Namibia, who helped us a lot and gave us an awning for the side). Aside the box we fitted the spare jerry cans. All the conversion was done in Oppi Koppi rest camp, Namibia, where Vital and Marianne provided the tools and space where we could work on the Land Rover. Thanks to them as well. Now the basic vehicle was finished, but it was lacking some decoration, so Andrea from Gelbingen Guest Farm painted animal footprints and black people on the Land Rover, which later turned out was a great help, because all police men were laughing about the vehicle and checks were done quite easy. Thanks Andrea! The basic conversion was finished and we could start.

To make matters worse, Meemaw enrolls Laney in tiny Millburgh Christian Academy and agrees to teach Puppetry in exchange for Laneyâs tuition. Though uncomfortable with the strict, religious atmosphere, sheâs excited by the attention cute, artistic, funny Calvin Berger gives her.

Will Laney adapt to a new life with her quirky grandmother and finally process the tragic event that sent her there?

Hey Jason, I think it's a question of science versus denialism. If the doctor says, "You shouldn't vaccinate your child because X." Or "Hey, it's really a tough call.

Ontario's government wants to deal with its budgetary deficit by underfunding our publicly funded health care system.On Jan. 15, talks between the Ontario Medical Association and Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care broke down and the government has slashed OHIP funding by three per cent. By the government's own estimates, Ontario's growing and aging population will need 2.7% more health care services annually. They proposed funding only 1.2 %, less than half of the anticipated growth in demand for services.If this sounds familiar, the MOHLTC tried this two years ago before bowing to public pressure to restore most of their unilateral cuts. The people of Ontario wanted a strong health care system and their voices were heard.OHIP is the provincial insurance plan that Ontario residents use to pay for their medical services. This is why you don't receive a bill when you go to the hospital, get an X-ray, get a blood test or see your doctor - your insurance covers it.You pay for this insurance through your taxes. Most people in Ontario understand this.OHIP billings represent the gross revenue a physician or health care institution bills in order to fund their medical practice. It helps to employs nurses and health care techs, pays for the rent, heat, telephones and electricity for a medical practice, purchases medical supplies like needles and bandages as well as new equipment and computers, among other things.Slashing OHIP is equivalent to cutting a patient's access to health care. The Liberal government will try to play patients against their doctors by telling you that they have simply cut doctors' salaries to fix their financial woes.But if you understand what I have just told you, you will realize they are misleading you.The Liberal government has run up a rather large budget deficit in addition to a multibillion-dollar debt that needs to be addressed. Cutting Ontario health care services is how they intend to do it.The government has just told Ontario's patients where they stand.Ontario's doctors, however, will continue to put their patients first.Douglas Crawford MD, President Simcoe County Medical Society

As we had still the Camper van, which was fully furnished and equipped, we had to think about how we convert it into a camping vehicle. There was the idea to strip it completely and build a box from 2Ã2.5 meters with a heights of 2 meters. We did not do that, because we simply could not afford it. So we took out the furniture from our camper van and adjusted it to fit into the Land Rover. So we have got storage for food and cloth, a bench to sit with table and an emergency bed, which is rather small but it is just for emergency. We bought two tents, a small one for one night stays, which is quickly pitched and a larger one, if we stay longer at a place which provides more comfort. So we had a space problem which we solved as follows: The sand ladders were fitted outside at the rear side windows, which are also a kind of protection against theft, and we had bought the Land Rover with a roof rack, where we build a simple box on it (thanks Rick from Kamanjab, Namibia, who helped us a lot and gave us an awning for the side). Aside the box we fitted the spare jerry cans. All the conversion was done in Oppi Koppi rest camp, Namibia, where Vital and Marianne provided the tools and space where we could work on the Land Rover. Thanks to them as well. Now the basic vehicle was finished, but it was lacking some decoration, so Andrea from Gelbingen Guest Farm painted animal footprints and black people on the Land Rover, which later turned out was a great help, because all police men were laughing about the vehicle and checks were done quite easy. Thanks Andrea! The basic conversion was finished and we could start.

*Correction, Feb. 13, 2015: The WHO first launched its immunization push to eliminate measles in 1974. This was followed in 2001 by the creation of the Measles & Rubella Initiative to further worldwide measles-eradication efforts. An earlier version of this story mistakenly cited 1988 as the date when the WHO began working to eliminate measles. This story has been updated in several places to reflect the correct dates.

This list is very valuable, Kathryn. I wish more women realized that one way to beat the earnings gap is through self-employment. Corporate pay is tied to the title you have. Most companies wonât pay someone more than the range for that title. Because women have had a hard time breaking through to the higher titles in their organizations, often for reasons that have nothing to do with performance, they often cannot get paid for what they actually contribute. Many women are surprised that once they start their own business and get it established in the first couple of years, they can earn two or three times what they did in a corporate job. Women-owned and minority-owned businesses are growing at faster rates than all businesses because more people are waking up to the fact that they cannot get equal pay for equal work in the current corporate world. But in your own business, there is no limit on what you can earn, other than your own capabilities.

Willis' side previously estimated a loss of $30 million from the claim that his iconic songs are adapted from original French songs.

Belolo did or didn't contribute to the creation of the songs. The publishers say that Willis, as plaintiff, carries the burden of disproving the writer credits contained on the copyright registration certificates. Willis, on the other hand, says that these certificates can't be presumed to be truthful if there's fraud involved and "at the best, the introduction of those certificates will simply place the ball in Mr. Willis' court to rebut the factual statements contained in them."

Instructions: In a cocktail shaker without ice, muddle three thin slices of jalapeÃ±o (for a pretty spicy cocktail; one slice will give it just a little tingle). Add 1 1/2 ounces of Campari, 1 1/2 ounces of cold coffee and ice. Shake that all up and double strainâthat's through your cocktail's strainer, as well as a fine mesh strainerâinto a rocks glass with fresh ice. Garnish with another jalapeÃ±o slice.

The reality: No one benefits from this plan except a handful of the super rich and the schools they support. Let's call it what it is: a backdoor voucher that would significantly benefit privates and charters.

Do you hate belly fat? Here are three foods that cause belly fat: Fatty foods All foods that have fat will cause you to have belly fat. Some of these foods are red, meat, cream and butter. In addition to giving you belly fat these foods contain a lot of saturated fats which are a major contributor of heart and artery-related diseases. Fried foods such as chips, corn dogs, and fried chicken contain plenty of fat and empty calories. Since the fried foods are usually coated in floury confections, they deliver a double dose of sugar and fat which are the primary drivers of belly fat.

Vyacheslav Korotki is a man of extreme solitude. He is a trained polyarnik, a specialist in the polar north, a meteorologist. In the past thirty years, he has lived on Russian ships and, more recently, in Khodovarikha, an Arctic outpost, where he was sent by the state to measure the temperatures, the snowfall, the winds. The outpost lies on a fingernail of a peninsula that juts into the Barents Sea. The closest town, by any definition, is an hour away by helicopter. He has a wife, but she lives far away, in Arkhangelsk. They have no children. On his rare visits to Arkhangelsk, he has trouble negotiating the traffic and the noise. Arkhangelsk is not Hong Kong. Korotki is sixty-three, and when he began his career he was an enthusiast, a romantic about the open spaces and the conditions of the Arctic. He watches the news on TV but doesnât fully believe it. Polyarniki were like cosmonauts, explorers for the Soviet state. There are fewer now. Who wants to live like this anymore? Evgenia Arbugaeva, a photographer who grew up in the Arctic town of Tiksi, spent two extended stays with Korotki. âThe world of cities is foreign to himâhe doesnât accept it,â she says. âI came with the idea of a lonely hermit who ran away from the world because of some heavy drama, but it wasnât true. He doesnât get lonely at all. He kind of disappears into tundra, into the snowstorms. He doesnât have a sense of self the way most people do. Itâs as if he were the wind, or the weather itself.â

When you're looking for a true Russian beauty, you don't need to look any further than Stela. This cute brunette might be out on the town all day long, shopping up a storm, but she prefers a night in once she gets home. Of course that night in consists of her bringing out her big taco pussy and introducing it to any number of her favorite sex toys. She thinks about taking a dick the size of her favorite big black sex toy in that taco, letting her juices flow all around it.

I begin to wonder whether the real radicalism we observe here is not political as much as formal: government with only the shallowest roots and no eye on the future, whose only interest is near-term PR wins.

 doubtless having been worsened by malnutrition and desperation. All the conflict for which legal aid was sought will still exist. The pressures on the legal system still exist, worsened by a surge in litigants in person (there has been a 30% rise in cases at the family courts in which both parties have to represent themselves). If you are taking even a medium-term view, it makes no sense to change systems without evidence. Cut indiscriminately, costs are likely to bob up elsewhere, where they will cost more and last longer.

st popular pages on VisitFinland.com. Maybe silence sells because, so often, we treat it as a tangible thingâsomething easily broken, like porcelain or crystal, and something delicate and valuable. Vikman remembers a time when she experienced the rarity of nearly complete silence. Standing in the Finnish wilderness, she strained her ears to pick out the faintest sounds of animals or wind. âItâs strange,â she says, âthe way you change. You have all the powerâyou can break the silence with even with the smallest sounds. And then you donât want to do it. You try to be as quiet as you can be.â

My experience both as a parent and teacher has been that the most experienced teachers ARE the most effective. Has there ever been a case where a young, effective teacher was cut due to seniority yes, of course. The belief that this is a common occurrence is simply myth. Most often, teachers self-select out early on. Many of us were cut early in our careers. Letâs suppose you need heart surgeryâ¦. do you want the surgeon who has experience treating many or the new, energetic âgo getterâ? The go getter could be the best ever but odd are they are not, not without experience. Experience teaches many, many things. Lastly, measurement of teacher effectiveness is a nebulous thing at best. With my own children, watching them have different teachers through the years I realized even more so how teacher effectiveness is very difficult to measure. My children had teachers whom I was suspect of and then it turned out they were quite wonderful, successful educators.

"Great tire â not as sharp steering as I would have liked but not bad at all. It felt a little tall in the front. The rubber compound felt rigid and lacked that hint of road feel I like. A very good tire nonetheless. It steered predictably with loads of grip but because it didnât have a ton of feel I worked into this tire slowly. And the more I leaned on them, the better they performed. Stability was excellent too, but they could be a tad bit more communicative."

To change the subject, and again arising out of this thread, I have noticed Nigel's habitual use of the epithet "cretin" when referring to Barak Obama. Now, I don't hold any particular brief for Obama, though I do think he is a great improvement on his predecessor in the presidency, someone to whom the term 'cretin' might more accurately be applied. But I'm intrigued by Nigel's use of such a perforative and inappropriate term for someone who, whatever ones' view of his politics, is clearly not a 'cretin' or anything like. I do wonder about Nigel sometimes.

Using a humidifier helps ease those symptoms, but once your nose is irritated, you want quick relief. The standby for most people is petroleum jelly which tends to get sticky (and smell a bit). Coconut oil helps with dry skin, so it makes sense it works for a dry nose too. Everyday Roots suggests a little of soft (but not melted) coconut oil applied with a cotton swab. The oil melts with the body heat on your skin and prevents cracking. Check out the link for other easy and inexpensive tips to deal with a dry nose.

Child of Fire and Blood begins the Theobroma series. Lar Kwa is the Lost Prince of Alban, absent from his frozen homeland of proud warriors for twenty years. Bearing Tshanâcasai, the ancient sword of his fathers, he is determined to use its potent magics to become savior to his troubled people. From the Crimson Throne, with Princess Treutelaar, Light of the People, at his side and advanced technology at his command, he plans to accomplish nothing short of the reformation of the fragmented empire forged by his family in days long past.Many oppose Lar Kwaâs ambitions, content with maintaining the status quo, but the prince has opened himself to guidance by forces beyond mortal ken. Of what consequence then are the wishes of mankind, the power of dragons, the intervention of isolationist warlords or the concerns of neighboring nations to a monarch willing to plunge half the world into war in order to rule it? Can the disturbing visions of one young misfit be of significance as elements of strange prophecies continue to manifest?As truths struggle to find the light, they will threaten not only the sanity of those involved, but to unravel the very fabric of reality.

Bikes kept Gregor Brown out of trouble growing up in Oklahoma â BMX, freestyle and then watching Greg LeMond's Tour de France wins on CBS television's weekend highlights shows. The drama of the 1998 Tour, however, truly drew him into the fold. With a growing curiosity in European races and lifestyle, he followed his heart and established camp on Lake Como's shores in 2004. Brown has been following the Giro, the Tour and every major race in Europe since 2006. He will tell you it is about the "race within the race" â punching out the news and running to finish â but he loves a proper dinner, un piatto tipico ed un vino della zona.

I love the Film Festival circuit, if only because it is fast becoming the only way to see non-blockbusters in theaters. There's certainly more to it than that, in that you can see things at festivals that you can't anywhere else (and possibly never again), and that it's a way to be part of a global conversation. I program a section of the Nashville Film Festival every year, and I have attended every New York Film Festival since 2002, and it absolutely helps to stay informed. I'm intimidated by the giant competitive festivals (unless I were to be on a jury) because there's always the creeping doubt that you're missing something amazing and world-changing, and that threatens to undercut your response to anything. As far as Festival buzz, I think it can be useful, but I've never found it to be a grand overriding force (at least not on the level I encounter it). At Cannes, Toronto, and Sundance, there's always such a rush to pronouncements and to be proven right about things, and that can get iffy. But I trust the critics whose voices I respect and have read for many years, and the good thing about having read a critic for awhile is that you learn where their blind spots are as regards certain genres, performers, or narrative events, and can adjust your own expectations accordingly.

Thanks Jason, 67P is a Jupiter family comet (comets with periods of less than 20 years) its moving inward toward it August 13th pass through perihelion and the nucleus will be jetting much more vigorously at that time so we will know a lot more about it then, But we already know the fluffy comet dust on its surface contains Glycine which is an amino acid that is a basic part of life but I would be willing to bet that if you were to break the comet in half there would not be Plasma at its core

 the principles of Science, right? It might take years, as do all projects, but they would have to convince Nasa to put that instrument on board one of the missions. Or, send up your own mission on a Russian, French, or Japanese, etc., rocket. Lots of options nowadays. I would be agreeable to that ideaâ¦ Iâd be open to it. Anybody else? But until then, Iâm steering away from any argument they have to offer, because me thinks that the strategy of repetition can work only as a strategy to convince, but fails as proof in reliable Science. So, ElecUniv folks, show us the beef! (And Iâve wasted another 15 minutes on this stuffâ¦ Echh.) Hannodb and betraymd, you owe me a reply, thank-youâ¦ â Meanwhile, I really look forward to next August and wonder if the crack in the âneckâ of 67/P will widen, and if weâll see other significant changes in the morphology of the comet, like a collapse of a shelf with boulders rolling a few tens of meters over the dusty surface where significant sublimation has occurred.

JMSN has released another video for a track off his self-titled album. The visual for "Score" follows in a vein similar to that of the lo-fi aesthetic of past videos, and serves as the third video released in support of JMSN's recent LP. In their post premiering JMSN's video for "Score," Vice writes that JMSN is looking to "explore the aftermath of relationships in his new video," which apparently is done by watching after and peeking into the lives of his ex-lovers. If there's one thing you can take from this video, it's that -- if you're an ex of his -- JMSN is always somewhere behind the shadows, and/or lurking behind the window. So, I guess you can keep that in mind next time you're brushing your hair, laying with your dog, or sitting down eating breakfast. You can watch the video for "Score" above.

Below the line, âLifeâ â not the most evocative title, though a fitting one for a film concerned with both physical and celluloid mortality â is composed and designed with lustrous attention to detail, yet avoids the blandly handsome veneer of many a nostalgic industry picture. Even the covetable city cars, viewed carefully, have surface dents and grazes, while Christensenâs perceptive camera occasionally picks up a smudge on the lens of Deanâs familiar tortoiseshell glasses â in a film wistfully dedicated to ways of seeing, no obstruction to our view goes amiss.

Thanks for your comment. I agree that these are not new ideas. Although business people talk as though maximizing shareholder value is obvious eternal truth, in fact, itâs a recent idea that got going as a result of Milton Friedman, was picked up by politicians and then spread like wildfire as it provided the basis for lavish and ever-growing CEO compensation. I believe that in a hundred yearâs time, people will look back on the last forty years as a very strange period when business went off on a bizarre and unproductive tangent.

Like Sheeran, Sam Smith is huge in England. After last night, he may be on that type of trajectory in America. It wasnât just winning four Grammys (though thatâll help). He was a pillar of humility every time he accepted an award. "I just want to say that before this album, I tried everything to try to get my music heard. I tried losing weight, and I was making terrible music. It wasnât until I started being myself that people started to listen." Thatâs beautiful stuff right there. He topped a near-perfect evening in transforming his hit âStay With Meâ into a gorgeous duet with Mary J. Blige, one that you could argue was better than the album version. On the Grammys stage. What else does Smith need to skyrocket?

When you're relying on restaurants at transportation hubs for frequent meals, you can save yourself the extra calories by simply ignoring the menu. "When we go out to restaurants, we want to eat what we won't eat at home," which often translates into sodium-packed dishes, says Politi. "If you don't look at the menu, you won't be tempted." Salad is the obvious choice, and most restaurants are willing to make modifications, such as putting the dressing on the side or swapping out included toppings (like fatty cheeses and meats) for healthier items, like black beans. Many eateries are becoming increasingly sensitive to your dietary needs. "Any fast-food or chain restaurant will have healthy options," says Politi. "It's up to you to make a good decision."

We do not yet see Wheeler actually applying Title II properly, in a way consistent with the limits described here (and his commentary has clearly been inconsistent with this characterization, both all along and at the moment of this announcement of the policy approach), but he has chosen the correct substantive basis to proceed on. The basis in Title II does put the law back on the grounds on which it's supposed to be based. Seth - - - - Susan Crawford, The Internet Is Back to Solid Regulatory Ground Feb 5 2015 http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/02/04/regulate-internet-providers/the-internet-is-back-to-solid-regulatory-ground The news that the head of the Federal Communications Commission just proposed that the agency should use its authority -- under Title II of the Telecommunications Act -- to oversee high-speed Internet access services should be welcomed by all who use the Internet. But let's be clear about what this is and isn't. He's not proposing to "regulate the Internet" or the websites of businesses that use the Internet to reach customers. This would not constrain what Americans can say online, nor would it constrain the extraordinary innovation that has come about because of the Internet's borderless and permission-free nature. Tom Wheeler is simply saying that the F.C.C. should have solid legal authority over the physical wires, tubes and towers located in the United States that move information from Point A to Point B. And that's all he's doing. Today, the private operators of this basic, two-way communications infrastructure -- in effect, the general-purpose replacement for the telephone network -- are free of any oversight. Left to their own devices, the companies selling Internet access will reasonably act to discriminate against existing competitors, make entry by new competitors more difficult, and make more money any way they can from their existing infrastructure -- including by collaborating with one another to divide markets. The F.C.C. has been worried about this kind of thing for a while now. But because a prior F.C.C. had taken a sharp deregulatory turn under then-chairman (now cable industry advocate) Michael Powell -- who put high-speed Internet access in an unregulated category under the Telecom Act -- the Obama-era F.C.C. was powerless to address these problems. The D.C. federal court of appeals twice told the F.C.C. that it couldn't regulate with one hand, by imposing "Open Internet" rules, for example, and deregulate with the other. Now, the chairman is saying that the F.C.C. will return to the solid regulatory ground that made the commercial Internet possible in the first place. High-speed Internet access is indeed a regulated service. This may not be good news for Comcast, Verizon, AT&T and Time Warner Cable -- who, among other things, want to make more money by demanding extra payments from popular online companies like Netflix -- but it is great news for every other part of American society. ------------------------------ Date: Thu, 05 Feb 2015 10:01:02 -0800 From: Gene Wirchenko <genew () telus net> Subject: Tom Wheeler makes history with full-on Net neutrality proposal (Paul Venezia) Paul Venezia, InfoWorld, 4 Feb 2015 http://www.infoworld.com/article/2878968/net-neutrality/fcc-tom-wheeler-internet-vote-title-ii-reclassification.html ------------------------------ Date: Feb 6, 2015 7:19 AM From: "Hendricks Dewayne" <dewayne () warpspeed com> Subject: UK access to NSA mass surveillance data was illegal, court rules (David Meyer) David Meyer, GigaOM, 6 Feb 2015, via Dave Farber https://gigaom.com/2015/02/06/uk-access-to-nsa-mass-surveillance-data-was-illegal-court-rules/ The system through which U.K. spy agency GCHQ can access data from NSA mass surveillance programs was in violation of fundamental rights, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal has ruled. However, the limits of that finding have left human rights groups dissatisfied. <https://gigaom.com/2014/10/28/uk-spies-can-get-intercepted-communications-from-nsa-without-warrant-government-lawyers-admit/> The decision came as a result of a case brought about by Privacy International, Liberty and other human rights groups regarding the Prism and Upstream programs. Prism is the scheme through which U.S. intelligence gets users' communications from service providers in that country, and Upstream intercepts bulk data from the Internet's core infrastructure. <http://www.ipt-uk.com/docs/Liberty_Ors_Judgment_6Feb15.pdf> In December the IPT ruled that it was legal in principle for GCHQ get data from these programs now -- i.e., from December 2014, in the post-Snowden world, where people actually know what's going on -- but it held back on saying whether there had been historical breaches of human rights. <https://gigaom.com/2014/12/05/uk-cable-tapping-programs-are-legal-spy-court-rules/> Having subsequently heard out both the complainants and the intelligence agencies, the tribunal said on Friday that the data-sharing regime had violated the rights to privacy and free expression, as set out in Articles 8 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. However, it reiterated that it believes the system now no longer does so. <http://www.ipt-uk.com/docs/Liberty-Order6Feb15.pdf> <http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf> In a statement on Friday, Privacy International said it and Pakistani NGO Bytes For All would ask the IPT, which generally acts as a secret court, to ``confirm whether their communications had been unlawfully collected prior to December 2014 and, if so, demand their immediate deletion.'' <https://gigaom.com/2014/01/09/pakistani-human-rights-group-sues-uk-government-over-surveillance/> The groups also disputed the December ruling's assertion that the disclosure of ``a limited subset of rules governing intelligence-sharing and mass surveillance'' made everything OK. They will now appeal that ruling with the European Court of Human Rights, as will Liberty. Here's what Liberty legal director James Welch said in the statement: We now know that, by keeping the public in the dark about their secret dealings with the National Security Agency, GCHQ acted unlawfully and violated our rights. That their activities are now deemed lawful is thanks only to the degree of disclosure Liberty and the other claimants were able to force from our secrecy-obsessed Government. But the Intelligence Services retain a largely unfettered power to rifle through millions of people's private communications, and the Tribunal believes the limited safeguards revealed during last year's legal proceedings are an adequate protection of our privacy. We disagree, and will be taking our fight to the European Court of Human Rights. ``We must not allow agencies to continue justifying mass surveillance programs using secret interpretations of secret laws,'' Privacy International deputy director Eric King added. ``The world owes Edward Snowden a great debt for blowing the whistle, and today's decision is a vindication of his actions.'' ------------------------------ Date: February 5, 2015 at 7:56:46 AM EST From: Hendricks Dewayne <dewayne () warpspeed com> Subject: PSA: Your crypto apps are useless unless you check them for backdoors (Dan Goodin) Dan Goodin, Ars Technica, 4 Feb 2015 Paranoid, or: How I learned to stop griping and love digital signatures. <http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/psa-your-crypto-apps-are-useless-unless-you-check-them-for-backdoors/> At the beginning of the year, I did something I've never done before: I made a new year's resolution. From here on out, I pledged, I would install only digitally signed software I could verify hadn't been tampered with by someone sitting between me and the website that made it available for download. It seemed like a modest undertaking, but in practice, it has already cost me a few hours of lost time. With practice, it's no longer the productivity killer it was. Still, the experience left me smarting. In some cases, the extra time I spent verifying signatures did little or nothing to make me more secure. And too many times, the sites that took the time to provide digital signatures gave little guidance on how to use them. Even worse, in one case, subpar security practices of some software providers undercut the protection that's supposed to be provided with digitally signed code. And in one extreme case, I installed the Adium instant messaging program with no assurance at all, effectively crossing my fingers that it hadn't been maliciously modified by state-sponsored spies or criminally motivated hackers. More about those deficiencies later -- let's begin first with an explanation of why digital signatures are necessary and how to go about verifying them. By now, most people are familiar with man-in-the-middle attacks. They're waged by someone with the ability to monitor traffic passing between an end user and a website -- for instance, a hacker sniffing an unsecured Wi-Fi connection or the National Security Agency sniffing the Internet backbone. When the data isn't encrypted, the attacker can not only read private communications but also replace legitimate software normally available for download with maliciously modified software. If the attack is done correctly, the end user will have no idea what's happening. Even when Web connections are encrypted with the HTTPS standard, highly skilled hackers still may be able to seed a website with malicious counterfeit downloads. That's where digital signatures come in. A prime candidate for such an attack is the OTR plugin for the Pidgin instant messenger. It provides the means to encrypt messages so (1) they can't be read by anyone monitoring the traffic sent between two parties and (2) each party can know for sure that the person on the other end is, in fact, who she claims to be. Fortunately, the OTR installer is provided through an encrypted HTTPS connection, which goes a long way to thwarting would-be man-in-the-middle attackers. But strict security practices require more, especially for software as sensitive as OTR. That's why the developers included a GPG signature users can check to verify that the executable file hasn't been altered in any way. I ended up burning about 90 minutes figuring out how to verify the signature using Gpg4win, the Windows-based e-mail encryption suite Ars wrote about almost two years ago. No doubt, more technically adept people than me would have spent only a small fraction of the time I did, but that misses the point. In a post-Snowden era, encryption is no longer the exclusive domain of developers, hackers, and technology professionals. Increasingly, it's a prerequisite for lawyers, journalists, and anyone else duty-bound to keep secrets. OTR didn't provide instructions, so I'll show how I did it, with the understanding that installation of Gpg4win, the Mac-based GnuPG, or a similar program for Linux is a prerequisite. (Fortunately, Gpg4win is digitally signed with a key that has been verified by a recognized certificate authority. The digital signature and checksums available online provide further verification.) First I downloaded the pidgin-otr-4.0.1.exe installer, the GPG signature for that file, and the public key the OTR developers used to generate the signature. I then opened Kleopatra, a key management program included with Gpg4win, clicked the Import button, and navigated to the directory storing the public key. (Alternatively, I could have right-clicked on the signature file and highlighted "More GpgEX options" and selected "Import keys.") Like magic, Kleopatra showed the key as belonging to the OTR Dev Team.

Just as auto-immune diseases cause the host to start attacking itself, our irrational fears have caused an auto-paranoia that is shredding our liberal democracies before our eyes. http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/31/terrorism-spectacle-how-states-respond-yuval-noah-harari-sapiens Yuval Noah Harari: the theatre of terror Terrorists have almost no military strength so they create a spectacle. How should states respond? The author of Sapiens, a history of humanity, reflects on the past, and alarming future, of the fear factor Yuval Noah Harari, 31 January 2015 As the literal meaning of the word indicates, terror is a military strategy that hopes to change the political situation by spreading fear rather than by causing material damage. This strategy is almost always adopted by very weak parties, who are unable to inflict much material damage on their enemies. Of course, every military action spreads fear. But in conventional warfare, fear is a byproduct of material losses, and is usually proportional to the force inflicting the losses. In terrorism, fear is the whole story, and there is an astounding disproportion between the actual strength of the terrorists and the fear they manage to inspire.

I love this post...it totally sums up what teaching and learning should focus on. It's given me some ideas to develop with my class. The comments written by the children are superb. I am working with mine to say, " It's hard but I will keep on trying!" I shall definitely adopt the soft toy /puppet approach as it makes the process more accessible. Thanks for sharing this.

Contrary to popular belief no one really has the answers on how to be the best stepparent. There are plenty of articles and advice from those that have lived it, and while those should be respected if only as a differing point of view, you donât have to agree. You need to do what is best for you and your step-family. For me, I choose to be the mom, not the friend to all my children, step or otherwise. My significant other and I are the two leading adults in our home, we are partners in the responsibility for raising healthy, happy and well adjusted children who we chose to love, care and discipline regardless of the person or whose child is whose. Children and stepchildren, are the same. Period. Maybe, one day the lack of involvement from the other parent will change, maybe it wonât â donât allow that to limit your involvement. Love your stepchildren/stepparents as best as you can, if you have to fake it at first, do that. If its not there, respect them.

But again, the lists and point totals are irrelevant to Caffey. As he stated entering the season, his goal is to lead the program back to the NCAA Tournament, in search of that first win since 1973.

r sits at No. 6 and No. 4 on each list respectively. Earlier in the season, Caffey became the fifth player in Long Beach State history to score more than 1,000 points and dish 400 assists in a career, joining Casper Ware, Ed Ratleff, Craig Hodges and Morlon Wiley.

I have to use your lion in lambs clothing comment for myself. I never labeled what I do but that is the perfect way to describe it. I would rather be the target than anyone else, not sure why but I just know I will be ok. We all need to delve deep inside and pull out all of the roots that connect you to behavior you do not like. Not all of us like the same thing so we are not all going to be the same. I personally don't think Earth made the animal kingdom out of a kind compassionate mold. We are not going to be peaceful rulers because the weight of billions of years of killing is inside of us. You are compassionate to the point that you open the lid on your rage, then you are as wild as any animal in the jungle.

Maggie Williamsâ most recent work involves the delicate reinterpretation of familiar images from art history. At first glance, the viewer is presented with another seemingly exhaustive reproduction from The Art Book. However upon closer inspection, nuances of alterations can be identified, enticing the viewer to reconsider the image and the artworkâs role within history.The redescription and transformation of an object or image is a theme that appears heavily throughout Williamsâ work. Whether the process is delicate or destructive, her artwork mirthfully reintroduces mundane objects in a newform. Maggie Williams (b.1989) is a British artist currently living and working in London. Since graduating in 2011, Williams has both organised and exhibited in numerous shows in London and further afield.

When an artist is murdered for their work, I think we all have to speak up and say #NotInMyName because this is not right. If you have a problem with what is being said you can either choose to ignore it, or bring that person to justice - and that's what they should have done instead of killing people.

The world's only 'married' lesbian threesome are expecting their first child.Doll, Kitten and Brynn, from Massachusetts, were joined together in a marriage-style ceremony last August and are expecting a daughter in July.Kitten, 27, is pregnant after undergoing IVF treatment using an anonymous sperm donor, and the trio eventually plan to have three children - one for each of them.The so-called 'throuple' worked with a specialist family lawyer who drew up the paperwork and drafted the ceremony so that all three of them were obligated and bound to each other .While Brynn and Kitten are legally married, Doll is "handfasted" to both so the threesome are as equally married to each other as legally possible.Doll, 30, says: 'As far as we know, there aren't any other three women who are married like us.'It was back in 2009 that Brynn first met Doll through an online dating site. Senior Software Designer and Engineer, Brynn had been married twice before to women and both experiences had made her acknowledge that monogamous relationships weren't for her.Meanwhile Fashion Designer, Doll had known that she was polygamous since high school. She explains: 'I had always dated girls - who although they had boyfriends or girlfriends - were also allowed to date me. 'I never thought that much about it and I had never really 'come out' as poly to my friends and family. To me, it was just how I was.'Brynn and Doll dated for eight months before moving in together. Two years later, they purchased a house together. Having both enjoyed polygamous relationships before, Doll and Brynn looked for a third woman to join them. After a few failed liaisons, Doll and Brynn created an OKCupid couple's profile. Eventually, they received a message from Kitten. Before meeting Doll and Brynn, Kitten had been in two long-term relationships with men. Her first relationship lasted ten years and she had been engaged to her second boyfriend.Fashion Manager, Kitten says: 'My second boyfriend and I had been together for several years but a few months before our wedding, he called the whole thing off without explanation. At first, I was distraught but now, I'm grateful for what he did. 'The whole break-up forced me to really think about who I was and I realized that I had not been honest to myself. On reflection, I realized that I hadn't been happy in my previous monogamous relationships and I discovered that I was poly.'I set up an OKCupid profile for myself and began dating an awesome woman with the happy consent of her husband. They were a lovely couple but we ended the relationship after I had to move away. 'Soon after that amicable break-up, I came across Doll's and Kitten's OKCupid profile and saw they were looking for a third member to join their 'Super Hero Group'.' #EndFathersDay #SingleMothersDay

Parents always know what's right for their children and, just like the Fifth Amendment protects us from absolutely any repercussions for anything we say, I have the right to voice my opinion and do what I please, because that's what freedom means. I get to make personal choices that I think are right for my child regardless of how it affects anyone else, and because I believe I am making the right choice for my child, it therefore is the right choice.

Some music is simple; some of itâs complex. True, popular artists, embody both. This isnât about the sound of the music or what itâs made with. Itâs where the artist sits in the world. Kanye didnât need to ruin Beckâs moment or tell him to give up the award. But he was asked a question about the award, and some people believe heâs not qualified to answer that question because he uses samples, auto-tune, drum-machines and doesnât play an instrument. This is dumb. The Grammys, unimportant though they may be, reinforce that view but time and time again put pop music created through collaboration below music created by individuals, put rap music below music with sweet sounding vocals, put black artists below white artists. Sometimes itâs worth being a dick about stuff like that.

PÃ©tillon says his project is a metaphor for many things: architectural decay, the uses of games in everyday life, and CO2 as "one of the mirages of society.

I can see that for some, this is excellent, but for me, it may add too much work. My bike fits nicely in my car when the front tire is off, I have made it a habit to leave my bike in my car when ever I'm not riding it...I also can chain my front tire to the rest of my bike when I lock it. The 'key' is similar to a quick release, but not as fast, plus you have to keep track of where you put the key. If I didn't remove my tire as often as I do, this would be perfect. the added security is very nice and I ended up preferring the seat skewer to match. I'm only talking about an extra 15 to 30 seconds to remove the tire, so it's not to big of a deal. Not to mention a much better alternative to replacing my rim, you're tube, etc. A spare key is a must though. Luckily they are super ready to order. All in all, very good product, especially if security is a concern!

t topic, so thanks for taking the time. Lots of teachers make the point, as you do, that showing children you are yourself part of a society with diverse values and characteristics, can be a powerful thing in itself that can connect with disaffected or marginalised students. However, hereâs a challenge to youâ¦ should you wish to accept it (as they say in Mission Impossible..!) and itâs this: Is there any point at which you think the publicâs confidence in a teacher would be justifiably be undermined by 1) the extent of body tattoos (or piercings) or 2) acute and morbid obesity? Or is there no point at which you would accept itâs an issue?

May prove to be interesting. Especially since they are NOT in the city of Decatur. I can remember when Boeing first came. We were told there would be 2,300 direct jobs and, at leats 5,000 indirect jobs. While these jobs are very much the higher tech & higher pay jobs we need, we did not get what we were told. You may perceive that this is an attempt to set the table to get "Decatur" to pay for more jobs that it never got and never will. Keep in mind that if "Morgan County" gives $1.00 in incentives, at least 70 cents of that was generated in Decatur. So it will be just as interesting to see if Morgan County and/or Decatur is asked to give. The public is usually kept in the dark on details. FOR EXAMPLE: After the Boeing facility was completed, the accesss road (and therefore all the maintenance costs) were deeded to Decatur. Another example of how Decatur gets the expenses and someone else gets any revenue.

Media Traffic was founded in 1998 by Fred Chuchel from Germany. In February began the test phase and in January 1999 the first official Top 40 track chart was released. It was the first attempt ever to create a global chart on a reliable base. In 2007 Media Traffic began to build a chart archive with the weekly Top 10 before 1999. The process is still running and comes to an end in 2014. The complete archive will be contain the period of 1955 until the present. 2002 started the test phase for the global album chart and the first official Top 40 list was released in January 2004. Through the years Media Traffic has developed to one of the best addresses for music charts and has nearly 900.000 views per month (URLmetrics 08/20/2013). The Top 40 lists are also the basis of various radio- & television-shows around the globe. Media Traffic has more than thousand external links and is published on other websites, for example Allcharts.org and ChartsInFrance.

This is a backing track for guitarists to contribute to. There are 16 bars of the chords and groove for you to solo over in whatever style you like with whatever sound you like, followed by 16 bars of a simple arpeggio riff: PLEASE play the riff in unison with me. Send the resulting audio file (GUITAR ONLY PLEASE!)as a 24-bit 44.1kHz wav file at jay@jaystapley.co.uk. Here's my plan: each guitar will come in one after the other, play its solo and join the Riff Orchestra playing the arpeggio (which I will loop to the end of the piece.) By the end of the piece I will release a full-length version featuring ALL the contributions I get that are useable (it may go on some time...) For the art fans amongst you. the piece is called "Discipline" and it explores the vocabulary of the contemporary electric guitar and contrasts it with an orchestral approach. If it ever makes more money than it costs to release I will invite all contributors to share the profits with me in a curry-house of my choice (The Boulevard, Friern Barnet possibly.)

Where some of the shows you don't really get the chance to converse with your favorite creators and they managed to pull it off. It was awesome!!!

There is too much in this scene to dissect: fantasies of an 11-year-old girl with a Cabbage Patch lunchbox, excessive references to that little girl as a âslutâ and Adam ripping off a condom to ejaculate on Hannahâs chest. No wonder it ends with Hannah saying she almost came.

A Teacher should listen sensitively. Listen to thoughts and feelings in a sensitive, non-threatening way. Communicate understanding by repeating back the essence of what the student has informed you. Try to take into account both the content and feelings. For example, "It sounds like you're not accustomed to such a big campus and you're feeling left out of things." Remember to let the student talk. Following up is an important part of the process. Check with the student later to find out how he or she is doing, and provide support as appropriate.

I'm living near Berlin, where the trend is completely reversed to what the article says. The Jewish community has seen significant growth in recent years. Especially young Israelis have come here in large numbers. I feel they authors are painting with a brush way too broad! You really have to differentiate. In Western Europe, the Jewish population has been fairly constant, in Germany it has been growing significantly in recent years. The dramatic drop which the article points to is all but emigration from the former Soviet Union to Israel, which, of course, to a large extent has to do with economic prospects. I know, anti-Semitism is still way too common in Russia, but even there, life is certainly considerably easier for a Jew than for, say, a Muslim from Central Asia or even a person from sub-Saharan Africa. Those a the people who are really discriminated against massively and are subject to harassment and violence just because of their appearance. Every self-identified Jew I have ever met in Russia was just 100 percent culturally assimilated, completely indistinguishable from a Russian. Therefore I don't think that mass emigration to Israel (and Germany) is primarily motivated by anti-Semitism but most of all by economic reasons.

This experiment resulted in some pretty surprising results. First, a âsuccessfulâ business man falls down on the sidewalk. Many people rush to his aid and help him back up, which is wonderful to see. But what happens when a man dressed like a homeless man falls? Watch the video to find out. The results are much different, and I will say that everyone should have helped out the âhomelessâ man the same as they helped out the âsuccessfulâ one.

Grace Woo is the rare tech entrepreneur who wants to reach people offline. As a grad student at MIT, she noticed that QR codes were âvisually obtrusiveâ and not all that useful, because they required so many steps. So the 28-year-old engineer developed a technology called video response codes that can turn any screen into an online interactive experience. VR codes are transmitted in the light emanating from a screen, which makes it possible to embed them in any digital surface, from a TV to a smartphone, and send information even if the device is not online: Think of exchanging contact information with someone merely by pointing your phones at each other. Going from the lab to âbuilding a company was a big decision for me,â Woo says. But Pixels.IO has the attention of major media companies such as the Home Shopping Network. In the future, if you can impulse buy by simply holding your phone to your TV, youâll probably have Woo to thank. Or blame.

Our political and economic leaders cannot have it both ways. If they want to promote good parenting and responsible family living, they need to make it more attainable for more people. Making money needs to not be so difficult that it leads to the sorts of lifestyles where parents must chose between working 50 hours a week for minimal pay with few benefits and not being able to provide decent living conditions for their families. Stop eroding benefits and wages and start adding to them to provide more social and economic equality. Mandatory paid sick leave and family leave would certainly be a step in the right direction. These steps have already been taken elsewhere without society totally falling apart. Ours wouldnât suffer that badly, either. Take care of the workers so they can take care of their families adequately, and some of the social safety net programs that the wealthy takers grumble so much about having to pay for may become less costly in the long run. Maybe they could start looking past the short-term bottom line for a social and economic system that is both more humane and more sustainable on a long-term basis.

MOBILE, ALâSaying the memories they made today would last the rest of their lives, gay couple Jeremy Newell and Aaron Mitchum of Mobile, AL confirmed Monday that they had always dreamed of getting married surrounded by hostility. âEveryone has big expectations about their wedding day, but never in a million years could I have imagined the tremendous outpouring of anger and contempt that we received from everyone who turned out,â said Newell, adding that as the newly married same-sex couple exited the courthouse they were overwhelmed with emotion upon seeing so many familiar, spiteful faces. âIt was just unbelievable that our commitment to each other brought so many people together to share their hate with us. I even got a little teary-eyed when I looked out at the crowd shouting homophobic slurs and expressing their wishes for us to burn in hell. Iâll never forget that.â At press time, the happy couple were driving away from the courthouse in their decorated wedding car at top speed.

 Cup in Seattle.

By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court's move on Monday to allow gay marriage to proceed in Alabama is the strongest signal yet that the justices are likely to rule in June that no state can restrict marriage to only heterosexual couples. Of the nine justices, only two - conservatives Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia - dissented from the court's refusal to block gay weddings from starting in Alabama. Gay marriage is now legal in 37 states. Thomas acknowledged in a dissenting opinion that the court's move to allow gay marriages to go ahead "may well be seen as a signal of the court's intended resolution" as it considers cases from four other states on whether same-sex marriage bans are permitted under the U.S. Constitution. Although only two justices publicly dissented, the court order did not reveal whether any other justices voted to grant the stay. Oral arguments in the cases, which are expected to result in a definitive nationwide ruling on the matter, are due in April with a decision expected by the end of June. Gay rights groups shared Thomas' view. Sarah Warbelow, Human Rights Campaign's legal director, said the justices' action on Alabama "has telegraphed there is virtually zero risk that they will issue an anti-equality ruling this summer." The group also told same-sex couples in the 13 states where gay marriage is still banned to "start your wedding plans now." Thomas' words echoed Scalia's 2013 dissent from the court's decision to invalidate a federal law that denied benefits to same-sex couples. Scalia predicted that the language of Justice Anthony Kennedy's opinion in that case would give judges a green light to strike down state gay marriage bans. That's exactly what happened. At the time of that ruling, only 12 of the 50 states permitted gay marriage. That number has now hit 37, with federal judges playing the central role in paving the way for gay marriage in 23 of the 25 states where it has become legal since then. As Thomas noted in his dissent, the court's normal practice would have been to put the Alabama case on hold until it had decided the cases involving the same-sex marriage bans in Ohio, Tennessee, Kentucky and Michigan. One of the factors the court considers when deciding whether to put a hold on a lower-court ruling is the "likelihood of success" for the petitioners if the case were to be appealed. The court in recent months has denied similar stay requests from other states, most recently Florida, thus allowing gay marriage to go ahead even while litigation continues. Alabama's case was different as it was the first application to be made after the high court's announcement in January to take the four cases and settle the matter once and for all.

You've got to do the #X thing so people will know you are driving and can't answer. Which leads to my confusion: aren't we not supposed to be texting and driving, how do you type #X?

Scifi writers donât predict the future, they make it. They write up the possibilities. The ones who like scifi are often the ones who like tech and who couple years afterwards end up as inventors or scientists, still remembering the possibilities/gadgets/technologies described in the books they read earlier. The best prophets are these that make self-fulfilling prophecies.

Of course, Apple and other tech companies are known to file technology patents that never end up in real products, but moving the TouchID sensor from the home button to the underneath a device's display makes a lot of sense. A physical home button takes up a lot of space on the iPhone's bottom bezel, so moving the sensor underneath the display and opting for an onscreen home button could allow Apple to design iPhones with a slimmer bezel altogether.

Dom can barely last five minutes at Esta Noche before he breaks down in Dorisâs arms outside. He has her, but he doesnât have Lynn, and yet now he has a renewed vigor to make his personal and professional dreams happen on his own terms. And Lynn has nothing to do with it anymore.

s been emotionally withholding and unsure of how much to invest in Dom as a romantic partner. âWhat am I to you? Am I Matthew? Where am I in the pantheon?â Dom demands reassurance that he means more to Lynn than fellow investee Matthew, but the underlying problem is Lynnâs continued devotion to his dead lover Brian, whom Dom feels he can never compare to. Lynn confirms that he has limits to how much heâll ever be able to let Dom inâand no, Dom is certainly not as throwaway as Matthew, but heâs also never going to be Brian. Lynn already had a Brian, and heâs not in the market for a replacement. âWhat weâre doing right now is all I got.â OUCH. âIf thatâs enough, then thatâs great. If itâs notââ and suddenly Dom is already out the door.

As we had still the Camper van, which was fully furnished and equipped, we had to think about how we convert it into a camping vehicle. There was the idea to strip it completely and build a box from 2Ã2.5 meters with a heights of 2 meters. We did not do that, because we simply could not afford it. So we took out the furniture from our camper van and adjusted it to fit into the Land Rover. So we have got storage for food and cloth, a bench to sit with table and an emergency bed, which is rather small but it is just for emergency. We bought two tents, a small one for one night stays, which is quickly pitched and a larger one, if we stay longer at a place which provides more comfort. So we had a space problem which we solved as follows: The sand ladders were fitted outside at the rear side windows, which are also a kind of protection against theft, and we had bought the Land Rover with a roof rack, where we build a simple box on it (thanks Rick from Kamanjab, Namibia, who helped us a lot and gave us an awning for the side). Aside the box we fitted the spare jerry cans. All the conversion was done in Oppi Koppi rest camp, Namibia, where Vital and Marianne provided the tools and space where we could work on the Land Rover. Thanks to them as well. Now the basic vehicle was finished, but it was lacking some decoration, so Andrea from Gelbingen Guest Farm painted animal footprints and black people on the Land Rover, which later turned out was a great help, because all police men were laughing about the vehicle and checks were done quite easy. Thanks Andrea! The basic conversion was finished and we could start.

MOBILE, ALâSaying the memories they made today would last the rest of their lives, gay couple Jeremy Newell and Aaron Mitchum of Mobile, AL confirmed Monday that they had always dreamed of getting married surrounded by hostility. âEveryone has big expectations about their wedding day, but never in a million years could I have imagined the tremendous outpouring of anger and contempt that we received from everyone who turned out,â said Newell, adding that as the newly married same-sex couple exited the courthouse they were overwhelmed with emotion upon seeing so many familiar, spiteful faces. âIt was just unbelievable that our commitment to each other brought so many people together to share their hate with us. I even got a little teary-eyed when I looked out at the crowd shouting homophobic slurs and expressing their wishes for us to burn in hell. Iâll never forget that.â At press time, the happy couple were driving away from the courthouse in their decorated wedding car at top speed.
