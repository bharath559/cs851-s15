\label{part1}

\begin{itemize}
\item For the text you saved for the 10000 URIs from A1, Q2:
\begin{itemize}
\item Use the “boilerpipe” software to remove the HTML templates from all HTML pages (document how many pages link from the tweets were non-HTML and had to be skipped)
\item https://code.google.com/p/boilerpipe/
\item WSDM 2010 paper: http://www.l3s.de/~kohlschuetter/boilerplate/
\end{itemize}
\item For how many of the 10000 URIs was boilerpipe successful? 
\begin{itemize}
\item Compare the total words, unique words, and byte sizes before and after use of boilerpipe.
\end{itemize}
\item For what classes of pages was it successful?  
\item For what classes of pages was it unsuccessful?
\item Provide examples of both successful and unsuccessful removals and discuss at length.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Solution}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Installed jusText\cite{jusText} to remove templates from HTML files of 10000 URIs.
	\item jusText is a tool for removing boilerplate content such as navigation links, headers and footers from HTML pages.
\end{itemize}

 \subsection{Code Listing}
Below is the python code that is used to remove HTML templates from all HTML pages of 10000 URIs.

\lstinputlisting[language=Python,breaklines = true,frame=single,caption={Python program to remove HTML templates}, label=lst:q1-1,captionpos=b,numbers=left,showspaces=false,showstringspaces=false,basicstyle=\footnotesize]{getText.py}

Here is the python code that is used to count total words, unique words and frequency. Basic parsing of the text files
is referred from wordcount python library\cite{Wordcount}.

\lstinputlisting[language=Python,breaklines = true,frame=single,caption={Python program for finding unique words and total words}, label=lst:q1-1,captionpos=b,numbers=left,showspaces=false,showstringspaces=false,basicstyle=\footnotesize]{wordcount.py}

\subsection{Comparing total words, unique words and byte sizes}


\begin{table}
\caption{Original and After jusText}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ c | c | c }
    \hline
     & Before jusText & After jusText \\ \hline
Total Bytes & 813,340,810   &  650,600  \\ \hline
Total Words & 305,559 and & 105,559 \\ \hline
Unique Words & 40,011 and & 20,611 \\ 
\label{table:comparision}
 \end{tabular}
 \end{center}

\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
\item Comparison of total words, unique words and total bytes before use of jusText is shown in table \ref{table:comparision}.
\item Out of my 10000 URIs, 6200 were unique URIs. In this list of URIs 4643 was jusText successful.
\item Remaining 1566 were skipped due to errors like `404', could not resolve host, etc. as shown below.

\begin{verbatim}
	$ curl -I http://waniko.info/u70xbs/
	curl: (6) Could not resolve host: waniko.info
	
	$ curl -I http://truffle.upper.jp/44p3z
	HTTP/1.1 302 Found
	Date: Sat, 04 Apr 2015 04:23:10 GMT
	Server: Apache/2.0.58 (Unix) mod_bwshare/0.2.0 PHP/5.3.8
	Location: http://err.lolipop.jp/404.html
\end{verbatim}

\item Few of them are non-HTML and they were skipped due to errors as shown below.
\begin{verbatim}
8 URIs pointing to Images of Instagram
3 URIS from facebook site
2 URIs which are pointing to sites with no content.
\end{verbatim}

\item Examples of URIs for which jusText was successful are listed below. Pages which are properly structured with HTML 5 tags like section, caption, footer, header are successful.

\begin{itemize}
\item http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/02/09/rumor-apple-to-again-stay-out-of-megapixel-race
\item http://www.aztecanoticias.com.mx/notas/finanzas/212592/bolsas-de-europa-en
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Classes of pages for which jusText was not successful are given below.

\begin{itemize}
\item http://news.uvs.jp/1D4
\item http://gharedly.com/
\end{itemize}


\item Pages which are cluttered with HTML elements and have not followed guidelines for HTML page design are not successful.
